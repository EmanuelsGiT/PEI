# Bottom-Up Approach â€“ O(n) time and O(n) space
# This approach uses dynamic programming to solve the Fibonacci problem by storing 
# previously calculated Fibonacci numbers, avoiding the repeated calculations of 
# the recursive approach. Instead of breaking down the problem recursively, it 
# iteratively builds up the solution by calculating Fibonacci numbers from the 
# bottom up.
